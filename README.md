## Installation

To install the package, create a new python 3.7 virtual environment (eg. using conda) and run:

    pip install "git+https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/MuE.git#egg=MuE[extras]" --use-feature=2020-resolver

To run the models at large scale, you will need to make sure you have access to a GPU with CUDA installed. See https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu for further support.
